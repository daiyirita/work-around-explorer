# work-around-explorer

## Introduction:
WorkAround is a research organization that provides data on salary trends in the tech industry. salaryData.js records the data they have collected. 

In this project, I help WorkAround design a new web application called WorkAround Explorer to make their data more easily viewable. This web app allows users to choose specific roles and companies in the tech industry to see the following information:

* The salary for the chosen role at the chosen company.
* The industry average for the chosen role.
* The average salary at the chosen company across all roles.
* The industry average salary across all roles and all companies.

## Technologies:
- Javascript ES6
- CSS
- HTML

## Result: <a href="https://daiyirita.github.io/work-around-explorer/"> WorkAround Explorer </a>
